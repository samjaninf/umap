# Configuration

uMap runs with Django, so any Django setting should work, if you know what you
are doing.

The Django settings reference is here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/

Here are a few relevant settings for uMap.

## Usage

Those settings should either:

- be in `/etc/umap/umap.conf`, which uMap will try to load by default
- be in a random place on your server, which is then reference with the
  `UMAP_SETTINGS` env var
- be declared as env vars directly, for simple ones (string/boolean/list)


#### ALLOWED_HOSTS

The hosts that uMap expects.
`ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['umap.mydomain.org']`

Can be set through env var too: `ALLOWED_HOSTS=umap.mydomain.org,u.mydomain.org`

#### DEBUG

Set it to `True` for easier debugging in case of error.

#### DEPRECATED_AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS

List of auth backends to deprecate. Defining this will display a message to
all users using this provider, to encourage them to configure another provider to
their account.

    DEPRECATED_AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ["social_core.backends.twitter_oauth2.TwitterOAuth2"]

#### EMAIL_BACKEND

Must be configured if you want uMap to send emails to anonymous users.

UMap can send the anonymous edit link by email. For this to work, you need to
add email specific settings. See [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/email/#smtp-backend)
documentation.

In general, you'll need to add something like this in your local settings:

```python title="local_settings.py"
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "youradmin@email.org"
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.provider.org"
EMAIL_PORT = 456
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "username"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "xxxx"
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
# or
EMAIL_USE_SSL = True
```

#### ENABLE_ACCOUNT_LOGIN

Do you want users to be able to create an account directly on your uMap instance
(instead of only using OAuth).

Can be set through env var: `ENABLE_ACCOUNT_LOGIN=1`

User accounts can be managed via the Django admin page (`{SITE_URL}/admin`).
The required superuser must be created on the command line with this command: `umap createsuperuser`.

#### DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL

See `EMAIL_BACKEND`.

#### LANGUAGE_CODE

Set it to the default language you want. `LANGUAGE_CODE = "it"`

#### Default map center
#### LEAFLET_LONGITUDE, LEAFLET_LATITUDE, LEAFLET_ZOOM

Default longitude, latitude and zoom for the map

#### MEDIA_ROOT

Where uMap should store your datalayers and icons, must be consistent with your
Nginx configuration.

See [Django documentation for MEDIA_ROOT](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#media-root)

#### OPENROUTESERVICE_APIKEY

API key for [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/). When defined, it will activate
elevation, routing and isochrone features on the map.

#### REALTIME_ENABLED

Setting `REALTIME_ENABLED` to `True` will allow users to enable real-time collaboration.
A switch will be available for them in the "advanced properties" of the map.

See [the documentation about ASGI deployment](../deploy/asgi.md) for more information.

#### REDIS_URL

Connection URL to the Redis server. Only need for the real-time editing.

Default: `redis://localhost:6379`

#### SECRET_KEY

Must be defined to something unique and secret.

Running uMap / Django with a known SECRET_KEY defeats many of Django’s security protections, and can lead to privilege escalation and remote code execution vulnerabilities.

See [Django documentation for SECRET_KEY](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#secret-key)


#### SHORT_SITE_URL

If you have a short domain for sharing links.

Eg.: `SHORT_SITE_URL=https://u.umap.org`


#### SITE_NAME

The name of the site, to be used in header.


#### SITE_DESCRIPTION

The description of the site, to be used in HTML title.


#### SITE_URL

The final URL of you instance, including the protocol:

`SITE_URL=http://umap.org`


#### SOCIAL_AUTH_OPENSTREETMAP_OAUTH2_KEY, SOCIAL_AUTH_OPENSTREETMAP_OAUTH2_SECRET

If you use OpenStreetMap as OAuth 2 provider, you can use those settings.

Otherwise, use any valid [python-social-auth configuration](https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/django.html).


#### STATIC_ROOT

Where uMap should store static files (CSS, JS…), must be consistent with your
Nginx configuration.

See [Django documentation for STATIC_ROOT](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#static-root)


#### STORAGES

See [storage](storage.md).


#### USE_I18N

Default is True. Set it to False if you don't want uMap to localize the app.

#### USER_AUTOCOMPLETE_FIELDS

Which fields to search when autocompleting users (in permissions).
Eg.: `USER_AUTOCOMPLETE_FIELDS = ["^username", "email"]`


#### USER_DISPLAY_NAME

Advanced setting for controlling which user fields will be used for displaying
their name on the application, depending on which fields you collect with your
OAuth configuration.
For example: `USER_DISPLAY_NAME = "{username}"`

#### USER_URL_FIELD

Which field to be used in URL for user. Must be a unique field.

Eg.: `USER_URL_FIELD = "pk"`

#### UMAP_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS

Should uMap allows user without an account to create maps (default is False).

Can be set through env var: `UMAP_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=1`

#### UMAP_ALLOW_EDIT_PROFILE

Should uMap allows users to edit their profile (default is True).

Can be unset through env var: `UMAP_ALLOW_EDIT_PROFILE=0`

#### UMAP_CUSTOM_TEMPLATES

```python title="local_settings.py"
UMAP_EXTRA_URLS = {
    'routing': 'http://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=osrm_car&route={lat},{lng}&locale={locale}#map={zoom}/{lat}/{lng}',
    'ajax_proxy': '/ajax-proxy/?url={url}&ttl={ttl}',
    'search': 'https://photon.komoot.io/api/?',
}
```

#### UMAP_DEFAULT_EDIT_STATUS

Define the map default edit status.
Possible values:

- 1 (Everyone)
- 2 (Editors only)
- 3 (Owner only)

    },
]
```


#### UMAP_HOME_FEED

- `"highlighted"`, which shows the maps that have been starred by a staff member
- `None`, which does not show any map on the home page

#### UMAP_HOST_INFOS

}
```


#### UMAP_IMPORTERS

Activate preset importers to connect uMap with external sources.

Must be a dict in the form: `{"importer_name": {"option1": "value"}}`.

Only the key is mandatory to activate an importer (eg. `{"overpass": {}}`).

Example:

```python title="local_settings.py"
UMAP_IMPORTERS = {
    "geodatamine": {"name": "my custom name"},
    "overpass": {"url": "https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter"},
    "communesfr": {"name": "Communes françaises"},
    "datasets": {
        "choices": [
            {
                "label": "Régions",
                "url": "https://domain.org/path/to/file.geojson",
                "format": "geojson",
            },
            {
                "label": "Départements",
                "url": "https://domain.org/path/to/other/file.csv",
                "format": "csv",
            },
        ]
    },
}

```

See [Importers](./importers.md) for more details on the available importers.

#### UMAP_KEEP_VERSIONS

How many datalayer versions to keep. 10 by default.

#### UMAP_LABEL_KEYS

List of properties to consider as "Feature label" (to show in popup or in browser).

    UMAP_LABEL_KEYS = ["name", "title"]

#### UMAP_MAPS_PER_PAGE

How many maps to show in maps list, like search or home page.

#### UMAP_MAPS_PER_SEARCH

How many total maps to return in the search.

#### UMAP_MAPS_PER_PAGE_OWNER

How many maps to show in the user "my maps" page.

#### UMAP_PICTOGRAMS_COLLECTIONS

List of icon sets available. When defined, this will replace the pictograms
set through the uMap admin.

See [icons](icons.md) page.

```python title="settings.py"
UMAP_PICTOGRAMS_COLLECTIONS = {
    "MyCollection": {"path": "/path/to/collection", "attribution": "Someone"},
    "OtherCollection": {"path": "/path/to/other", "attribution": "Else"},
}
```


#### UMAP_SEARCH_CONFIGURATION

Use it if you take control over the search configuration.

UMap uses PostgreSQL tsvector for searching. In case your database is big, you
may want to add an index. For that, here are the SQL commands to run:

```SQL
# Create a basic search configuration
CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION umapdict (COPY=simple);

# If you also want to deal with accents and case, add this before creating the index
CREATE EXTENSION unaccent;
CREATE EXTENSION btree_gin;
ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION umapdict ALTER MAPPING FOR hword, hword_part, word WITH unaccent, simple;

# Now create the index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS search_idx ON umap_map USING GIN(to_tsvector('umapdict', COALESCE(name, ''::character varying)::text), share_status, tags);

# You should also create an index for tag filtering:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS tags_idx ON umap_map USING GIN(share_status, tags);
```

Then set:

```python title="settings.py"
UMAP_SEARCH_CONFIGURATION = "umapdict"
```

#### UMAP_READONLY

Is your instance readonly? Useful for server maintenance.

#### UMAP_GZIP

Should uMap gzip datalayers geojson.

#### UMAP_XSENDFILE_HEADER

Can be set to `X-Accel-Redirect` to enable the [NGINX X-Accel](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/xsendfile/) feature.

See the NGINX documentation in addition.
