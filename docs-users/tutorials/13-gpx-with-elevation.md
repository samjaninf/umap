    - Create a map from a GPX file
    - Display an elevation chart for that trace


## 1. Create a map from a GPX file

You simply have to drag&drop a GPX file above the map to automagically create a datalayer with these data.

A line should appear on the map with optional pre-defined points according to your source file:

## 2. Display an elevation chart

Perform a right-click **on the line** and choose the editing pencil.


Open `Interaction options` and switch `Popup shape` to `Popup (large)` to give some room to the incoming graph.
Then change the `Popup content style` from `Default` to `Route`.

You should see the popup in the background gaining an elevation graph:

Youâ€™ll notice that when hovering the graph, the current position is made visible on the map (orange point on the line) and the elevation is dynamically updated within the popup:
